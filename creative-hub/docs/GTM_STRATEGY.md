# White Tiger Go-To-Market Strategy
## Win Hearts, Minds, and Wallets

**Created**: December 30, 2025
**Brand**: White Tiger (Cyberpunk Purple)
**Target**: Meme Coin Creators + Hip Hop Artists

---

## THE VISION

**"Be the first thing every meme coin creator uses to make their anthem."**

White Tiger sits at the intersection of three massive trends:
1. **Meme Coin Explosion** - New coins launching daily, all need branding
2. **AI Music Revolution** - Generation tools becoming accessible
3. **Telegram Ecosystem** - 950M+ users, TON blockchain integration

---

## BUSINESS LOGIC SUMMARY

### Revenue Model

| Tier | Stars | TON | Features |
|------|-------|-----|----------|
| **Free** | $0 | $0 | 3 tracks/month, watermarked |
| **Creator** | 200 ($3.99) | 2 TON (~$12) | 50 tracks, no watermark |
| **Studio** | 500 ($9.99) | 5 TON (~$30) | Unlimited, API access |

### Unit Economics

| Payment | Creator Margin | Studio Margin |
|---------|----------------|---------------|
| Stars | 15% | -6% (LOSES money) |
| TON | **80%** | **75%** |
| x402 USDC | **100%** | **100%** |

**Critical Insight**: Push TON/USDC payments. Stars barely profitable.
