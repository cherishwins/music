**Maker Comment:**
```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I built White Tiger because I noticed something: every meme coin community needs a hype anthem, but there's no tool that actually understands what they need.

After analyzing 4,800+ viral hip hop tracks, I discovered the "Loop-First" pattern - viral songs have 3x more word repetition and 150x more hooks than non-viral tracks. So I built an AI that generates music optimized for TikTok virality.

Would love your feedback! What features would make this more useful for your community?

## HACKER NEWS (Show HN)

**Title:**
```
Show HN: White Tiger – AI music generator for meme coin creators
```

**Body:**
```
I built an AI music generator specifically for meme coin creators and hip hop artists.

The core insight: After analyzing 4,800+ viral hip hop tracks, I found that viral songs have:
- 3x more word repetition
- 150x more hook phrases
- 60%+ short lines (≤6 words)

I call this "Loop-First Lyric Design" - optimizing for TikTok's 15-60 second format.

Technical details:
- Qdrant vector DB with 4,832 hip hop embeddings
- Viral score analysis (repetition ratio, hook density, line length)
- ElevenLabs for music generation
- x402 micropayments for AI agent access
- MCP server for Claude Desktop integration

Available as:
- Telegram Mini App: https://t.me/MSUCOBot
- Web: https://creative-hub-virid.vercel.app
- MCP: npx @whitetiger/mcp-music

Pricing: First generation free, then $0.50/track

Looking for feedback on:
1. The viral score algorithm - is this useful?
2. MCP server design - what other creative tools would be valuable?
3. Pricing model - per-track vs subscription?

Built an AI tool that generates phonk beats optimized for TikTok virality – looking for producer feedback
```

**Body:**
```
Hey everyone,

I've been working on an AI music generator called White Tiger that specifically targets phonk/trap production with TikTok virality in mind.

The core tech:
- Analyzed 4,800+ viral hip hop tracks to identify patterns
- Found that viral tracks have 3x more repetition and 150x more hook phrases
- Built a "Loop-First" algorithm that optimizes lyrics for short-form content

What it generates:
- Phonk beats with Memphis-style cowbells and 808s
- K-phonk fusion with melodic hooks
- Drill, trap, lo-fi variations
- Lyrics optimized for catchiness

I'd love feedback from actual producers:
1. How does the beat quality compare to what you'd use?
2. Is the 60-second default duration right for the use case?
3. What production elements are missing?

Try it: https://t.me/MSUCOBot (first gen free)

Not trying to replace producers – more like a sketch tool for quick ideas. Curious what you think.

Launching a new token and need a hype anthem? I built White Tiger – an AI music generator specifically for meme coins.

**What it does:**
- Generates phonk/trap beats optimized for TikTok virality
- Creates "Loop-First" lyrics designed to get stuck in your head
- Analyzes your content's viral potential (0-100 score)

**Why I built it:**
Every meme coin community needs a viral anthem. But hiring musicians is expensive ($500+) and stock music is generic. I trained an AI on 4,800+ viral hip hop tracks to understand what actually goes viral.

**Key finding:** Viral tracks have 3x more word repetition and 150x more hooks. So I built an AI that maximizes these patterns.

**Try it:**

Not financial advice, just vibes. What do you think?
