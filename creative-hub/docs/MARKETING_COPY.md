## TWITTER THREAD: "How I Check Every Meme Coin"

**Tweet 1:**
```
How I check every TON meme coin before buying (free method):

I got rugged 3 times before I built this.
Now I check every single token in <10 seconds.

Here's the exact process 🧵
```

**Tweet 2:**
```
Step 1: Get the minter's wallet address

Every token has a deployer.
That deployer has history.

If they've rugged before, they'll rug again.
```

**Tweet 3:**
```
Step 2: Run it through the rug scanner

I built @MSUCOBot after losing $800 to rugs.

It checks:
- Known scammer database (112+ flagged)
- Previous token launches
- Contract safety factors
- Wallet behavior patterns
```

**Tweet 4:**
```
Step 3: Read the score

Score 0-1000 (like a credit score for crypto)

900+ = Generally safe
700-900 = Proceed with caution
500-700 = High risk gamble
<500 = Probably a rug

I don't ape anything under 600.
```

**Tweet 5:**
```
Step 4: Check the warnings

The bot tells you exactly WHY it's risky:
- "Mint authority enabled" = can print infinite tokens
- "Liquidity not locked" = can pull the rug
- "Connected to known scammer" = RUN

One warning? Maybe okay.
Three warnings? Don't touch it.
```

**Tweet 6:**
```
That's it. Takes 10 seconds.

Saved me from at least 5 rugs this month.

Free to use: t.me/MSUCOBot

DYOR, but let the bot do the math.

## ENGAGEMENT REPLIES

### When Someone Gets Rugged

```
Damn, sorry anon. Hate seeing this happen.

If it helps, I check every token with t.me/MSUCOBot now.
Free scammer detection + risk analysis.

Won't get your money back but might save you next time.
```

### When Someone Asks "What Bot Do You Use?"

```
t.me/MSUCOBot

Free rug checks. Just paste wallet address.
It checks the minter's history + contract + scammer database.

Not financial advice but I don't ape anything under 600 score.
```

### When New Token Launches

Anyone checked the minter yet?

Running it through the scanner now...
