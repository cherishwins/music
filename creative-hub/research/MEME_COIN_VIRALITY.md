# **The Sonic Economy of Speculation: An Exhaustive Analysis of Viral Meme Coin Music Mechanics (2024–2025)**

## **1\. Introduction: The Auditory Layer of Digital Finance**

The financial landscape of the 2024–2025 cryptocurrency cycle has been defined not merely by price action or blockchain utility, but by a profound evolution in the cultural transmission of value. While the bull market of 2021 was primarily visual—dominated by static JPEGs, meme images, and text-based slogans—the current cycle has witnessed the emergence of a sophisticated, multi-sensory apparatus where audio plays a central, if not dominant, role. This report provides an exhaustive analysis of the "meme coin anthem," a distinct sub-genre of digital media that functions as the heartbeat of speculative communities. We examine specifically how audio elements drive virality on platforms like Telegram and Twitter (X), focusing on the leading tokens of the era: Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Pepe (PEPE), Dogwifhat (WIF), Bonk (BONK), and Popcat (POPCAT).

The premise of this research is that meme coin music is not incidental background noise. rather, it is a sophisticated, functional technology of social coordination. It serves as a rallying cry during market downturns, a viral hook for user acquisition on social media, and a marker of tribal identity in an increasingly fractured attention economy. Through the analysis of tempo, lyrical themes, and platform-specific propagation mechanics, we reveal how sound waves are transmuted into market capitalization. Furthermore, we explore the disruptive impact of generative AI tools like Suno and Udio, which have democratized the production of high-fidelity musical propaganda, flooding the market with over 100,000 algorithmic tracks in a mere six-month window.1

This document is structured to provide a granular dissection of these phenomena. We begin by establishing the macroeconomic and cultural context of the 2024 resurgence of "meme investing," then move into a technical analysis of the musical structures that define viral hits. We proceed to platform dynamics, offering a detailed critique of how Telegram and Twitter algorithms privilege specific audio types. Finally, we offer deep-dive case studies of the "Big Six" tokens, contrasting the nihilistic lo-fi aesthetics of Dogwifhat with the polished, lyrical satire of Bonk, and concluding with a theoretical framework for the future of audio-financial assets.

### **1.1 The Macro-Context: Meme Investing Redux (2024–2025)**

To understand the music, one must understand the market it serves. After the catastrophic crash of 2022, "meme investing" experienced an unexpected and aggressive comeback in 2024\.2 This resurgence was driven by a shift in retail sentiment. For many prudent investors, the notion of speculating on assets with zero utility—like a dog wearing a hat—is "downright offensive".2 However, for a new generation of digital natives, this lack of utility is the point. It is a rejection of traditional financial valuation models in favor of a pure attention economy.

In this environment, the "viral song" becomes a critical asset. It is the marketing collateral that bridges the gap between a niche crypto-community and the broader internet. As trading volumes for Solana-based meme coins escalated to over $8 billion in early 2024 2, the competition for attention became fierce. Projects could no longer rely on a funny image alone; they needed a soundtrack. The music of 2024–2025 reflects the volatility of the market itself: fast, aggressive, absurd, and deeply self-referential. It draws on the "viral nature of internet culture" to create speculative bubbles that inflate and deflate to the rhythm of a beat.2

### **1.2 The Shift from Remix to Generative Culture**

A defining characteristic of the 2024–2025 cycle is the transition from human-curated remixes to AI-generated original compositions. In previous cycles, meme coin music largely consisted of remixing existing pop songs (e.g., parodying "Pump it Up"). However, the release of advanced AI music generation models has fundamentally altered this landscape. The research indicates that between May and October 2024 alone, a dataset of 101,953 songs was collected from platforms like Udio and Suno.1 This explosion of content means that communities can now generate bespoke soundtracks for every micro-event in the market. A 5% price drop can instantly spawn a melancholic country ballad about "holding the bag," while a green candle can trigger the release of a high-energy techno anthem. This capability has accelerated the metabolism of meme culture, creating a feedback loop where the music and the market move in near-perfect synchronization.

**2\. The Psychology of Viral Audio: Tempo, Frequency, and Retention**

The viral success of meme coin music is grounded in specific psycho-acoustic principles. The goal of these tracks is not artistic expression in the traditional sense, but rather "retention" and "conversion." They are engineered to arrest the scroll on social media feeds and to induce a state of heightened arousal (hype) in listeners.

### **2.1 Tempo and the Rhythm of Volatility**

The analysis of viral tracks across the studied tokens reveals a distinct preference for high-tempo compositions. The most shared clips and anthems typically fall into the 140–175 BPM (Beats Per Minute) range. This tempo is significant for several reasons. Biologically, music at this speed mimics the heart rate during periods of intense physical exertion or adrenaline release. For a trader watching a price chart move rapidly, high-BPM music reinforces the physiological sensation of risk and excitement.

We observe two distinct rhythmic archetypes:

1. **The Aggressive Pump (160+ BPM):** Often associated with tokens like PEPE and aggressive "raid" tactics on Telegram. These tracks draw from genres like Phonk, Hardstyle, and Drum and Bass. The driving, relentless percussion mirrors the desired "up only" price action.  
2. **The Dopamine Loop (120-130 BPM):** Seen in the "Popcat" phenomenon and WIF content. This tempo aligns with the standard house music beat, which is mathematically optimized for danceability and looping. The "Popcat" videos, which feature a cat opening its mouth to the beat, rely on this "lock-step" synchronization between audio and visual stimuli to create a hypnotic effect.3

### **2.2 The "Brain Rot" Aesthetic and Attention Spans**

The aesthetic of 2024–2025 meme music is often described by the colloquialism "brain rot." This term refers to content that is deliberately nonsensical, over-stimulated, and repetitive. It is a direct response to the "short-form tyranny" of TikTok and Twitter video limits. A viral meme coin song must make its impact within the first three seconds.

The music often employs "bit-crushing," distortion, and volume maximization (loudness wars) to ensure it stands out on tinny smartphone speakers. The "Popcat" theme, characterized by the repetitive syllable "Ba," is a prime example of this.3 It bypasses the language processing centers of the brain and appeals directly to the rhythmic centers. This reduction of complexity is a strategic advantage in a global market; one does not need to speak English to understand the "Ba Ba Ba" song, facilitating the token's spread across non-English speaking Telegram groups in Asia and Eastern Europe.

### **2.3 Lyrical Minimalism and the Hook**

Lyrical themes in this genre are characterized by extreme minimalism or "ticker repetition." The most effective hooks are often just the name of the coin or a simple command repeated ad nauseam (e.g., "Buy the dip," "HODL," "Bonk").

However, a divergence is observed in the 2025 data with the rise of narrative anthems. The song "NICE SHOT\!" associated with the BONK token demonstrates a more sophisticated lyrical structure.4 It utilizes satire, rhyme schemes, and storytelling ("Target practice on the other side / While counting coins with national pride") to build a complex narrative about trading skill and karma. This suggests a maturation of the genre, where "blue-chip" meme coins commission or produce music that functions as genuine brand storytelling rather than just noise.

## ---

**3\. Platform Dynamics: The Engine of Virality**

The virality of meme coin music is not platform-agnostic. It is the result of a complex interplay between the technical architecture of specific social networks—primarily Telegram and Twitter (X)—and the behavioral patterns of the crypto-community.

### **3.1 Telegram: The Incubator and the Echo Chamber**

Telegram serves as the "backend" of the meme coin economy. It is where the community organizes, and it is where the music is weaponized for internal cohesion.

The Mechanics of the "Raid":  
In Telegram, music is used operationally during "raids"—coordinated efforts where community members flood social media posts with comments and memes. During a raid, voice chats are often hosted where DJs or bots play high-energy, aggressive music to maintain morale. This creates a Pavlovian association: when the music starts, the work begins. The tracks chosen for these moments are rarely melodic; they are rhythmic, repetitive, and loud, designed to induce a trance-like state of focus.  
Exclusive "Alpha" Distribution:  
New AI-generated songs often debut in Telegram channels as exclusive content before being released to the public. This creates a sense of privilege for community members. A user might hear a new "WIF anthem" in the Telegram chat and then feel compelled to share it on Twitter to signal their insider status. This mechanism turns the community into a decentralized distribution network.5

### **3.2 Twitter (X): The Billboard and the Algorithmic Lottery**

If Telegram is the backend, Twitter is the frontend. It is the primary vector for new user acquisition.

Visual Anchoring:  
On Twitter, audio rarely travels alone; it is almost always attached to a video. The research indicates that the "scroll-stopping" power of a meme coin tweet is heavily dependent on the audio track. The "Popcat" videos are a testament to this; the visual of the popping cat is virtually meaningless without the accompanying "pop" sound or the synchronized music.3 The audio anchors the visual, making the user pause long enough for the tweet to register as a "view" in the algorithm.  
The Role of Influencers (KOLs):  
The "Ansem Effect" 6 illustrates the power of influencer curation. When a high-profile figure like Ansem tweets a video with a specific track, or plays a song during a Twitter Space, that track instantly gains legitimacy. The community then rushes to remix that track, creating a "viral cluster" around the audio. This creates a mimetic desire: to be like the influencer, one must listen to the influencer's music.

### **3.3 TikTok: The Mainstream Funnel**

While less central to the core "degen" economy, TikTok serves as the bridge to the mainstream (or "normies"). The "Popcat" meme’s crossover success was largely driven by TikTok trends where users—unaware of the crypto association—remixed the cat for non-financial jokes.3 When a meme coin song breaches the containment of Crypto Twitter and trends on TikTok, the token price often reacts violently, as a new wave of retail capital enters the market.

### **Table 1: Platform-Specific Audio Dynamics**

| Feature | Telegram | Twitter (X) | TikTok |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Primary Function** | Retention & Morale | Discovery & Shilling | Mainstream Crossover |
| **Audio Type** | Continuous Streams, High-BPM Loops | Short Clips (15-45s), Music Videos | Trending Sounds, Remixes |
| **User Behavior** | Passive Listening (Voice Chats) | Active Sharing / Retweeting | Remixing / Dueting |
| **Viral Trigger** | Community "Raid" Events | Influencer Endorsement | Algorithmic "Trending Sound" |

**4\. The AI Disruption: Suno, Udio, and the Infinite Jukebox**

The 2024–2025 period is demarcated by the widespread adoption of AI music generation tools. This technological shift has had profound implications for the meme coin ecosystem, effectively reducing the marginal cost of music production to zero.

### **4.1 The Scale of Production**

The research highlights a staggering volume of AI-generated content. A dataset collected between May and October 2024 contained 101,953 songs (20,519 from Udio, 81,434 from Suno).1 This flood of content represents a "Cambrian Explosion" of meme music. Prior to this, a community might have one or two talented members capable of producing a track. Now, every member is a producer.

### **4.2 Suno vs. Udio: The Battle for the Meme Sound**

The choice of platform has begun to signal the "class" or "vibe" of the coin:

* **Suno:** Often associated with "pop-slop"—catchy, generic, radio-friendly tunes that are easy to digest but lack depth.8 These are used for quick reaction memes (e.g., a song celebrating a 10% price pump). The high volume of Suno tracks suggests it is the "fast food" of crypto audio.  
* **Udio:** Perceived as offering higher fidelity and more complex compositions.9 Communities looking to establish a more "premium" image (perhaps later-stage projects like SHIB or BONK) may lean towards Udio for their anthems.

### **4.3 The "Pop-Slop" Saturation Problem**

With over 100,000 songs flooding the market, a new challenge has emerged: saturation. The sheer volume of AI music makes it difficult for any single track to gain traction. This has led to a "survival of the weirdest" dynamic. To stand out amidst the "safe, sanitized" AI outputs 8, meme coin creators are prompting for increasingly bizarre, offensive, or avant-garde lyrics and genres. The "brain rot" aesthetic is partly a defense mechanism against the blandness of AI defaults.

### **4.4 Legal and Ethical Gray Zones**

The widespread use of these tools has occurred under a cloud of legal uncertainty. Major labels have sued services like Suno and Udio for copyright infringement, arguing that their models were trained on stolen music.11 However, in the decentralized, pseudo-anonymous world of meme coins, these legal threats are largely ignored. The culture operates on a philosophy of "permissionless innovation," where the speed of viral transmission outpaces the speed of litigation. For a meme coin that might only live for a week, long-term copyright liability is irrelevant.

**5\. Deep Dive Case Study: Dogwifhat (WIF)**

**Token Overview:** Dogwifhat (WIF) represents the "post-ironic" phase of meme coins. Its branding is aggressively simple: "literally just a dog wif a hat."

### **5.1 The Sound of Nihilism**

The viral music associated with WIF reflects its visual ethos. If the image is low-effort, the music must also convey a sense of effortless cool or deliberate amateurism.

* **Genre:** Lo-fi Hip Hop, erratic Techno, and "glitch" aesthetics.  
* **Lyrical Themes:** The primary theme is absurdity. The website's scrolling ticker text—"I mean bro, it's literally a dog wif a hat"—became a lyrical hook in itself.12 The music often features text-to-speech voices reading this phrase over chaotic beats. This reinforces the message that there is no deeper utility or roadmap; the coin exists for its own sake.

### **5.2 The Sphere Campaign and Anthems**

A major viral moment for WIF in 2024 was the fundraising campaign to project the mascot onto the Las Vegas Sphere.6 This event generated a wave of "anticipation" music—tracks that were triumphant, orchestral, or cinematic, designed to build hype for the (eventually delayed) projection. The contrast between the grandeur of the music and the silliness of the subject matter (a dog in a beanie) created a comedic dissonance that drove shares on Twitter.

### **5.3 Community Engagement**

WIF's community leveraged music to mock the seriousness of "utility" coins. While other projects released whitepapers, WIF released songs about hats. This strategic anti-intellectualism resonated with a market tired of complex DeFi promises that resulted in rugs. The music was a signal: "We promise nothing, so we cannot disappoint you."

## ---

**6\. Deep Dive Case Study: Bonk (BONK)**

**Token Overview:** BONK positions itself as the "social layer" of Solana. Unlike the nihilism of WIF, BONK has a more structured, almost corporate, approach to its meme status.

### **6.1 The "Nice Shot" Anthem**

The song "NICE SHOT\!" 4 stands out as a prime example of a "Meme Coin Anthem" (as opposed to background music).

* **Structure:** It is a full song with verses, a chorus, and a bridge. It features a "cheerful, female sing-song voice" delivering "satirical jazzy pop."  
* **Lyrical Analysis:** The lyrics are highly specific to the trading experience. Phrases like "Target practice on the other side" and "Ricochet whistle / Coming back around" allude to the PVP (Player vs Player) nature of crypto markets. The chorus "NICE SHOT\! / Look what karma's gonna bring\!" reframes the act of trading as a moral battle where the "bonkers" (holders) are dispensing justice.  
* **Function:** This song is not just for hype; it is for *lore*. It tells a story about the community's identity as sharp-shooters who punish those who bet against them.

### **6.2 Solana Integration**

BONK's success is tied to its integration with the Solana ecosystem.13 The music often reflects the "speed" and "efficiency" of Solana—upbeat, fast-paced, and futuristic. The "Bonk" sound effect itself—a cartoonish impact sound—is often used as a rhythmic element in remixes, creating a sonic brand signature that is instantly satisfying to hear.

## ---

**7\. Deep Dive Case Study: Popcat (POPCAT)**

**Token Overview:** Popcat is unique in that it is an interactive web-meme first, and a coin second. The core mechanic is a cat that opens its mouth (pops) when clicked.

### **7.1 The "Ba Ba Ba" Phenomenon**

Research indicates that the specific song associated with Popcat—a fast-paced track consisting of the syllable "Ba"—is critical to its virality.3

* **Audio-Visual Sync:** The viral hook is the synchronization. The cat's mouth opens on every "Ba." This creates a satisfying sensory loop. Users watch the video repeatedly not for the information, but for the tactile satisfaction of the sync.  
* **Remixability:** Because the "Pop" is a percussive sound, it can be superimposed onto any track. We see remixes ranging from "Cotton Eye Joe" to 6IX9INE rap tracks.14 The cat becomes a musical instrument.

### **7.2 Mainstream Crossover**

Unlike WIF or BONK, whose music is laden with crypto-slang, Popcat's music is universal. The "Ba Ba Ba" song has no language. This allowed Popcat to go viral on mainstream TikTok 7, drawing in users who found the cat cute and the music catchy, inadvertently funneling them into the crypto ecosystem.

## ---

**8\. Deep Dive Case Study: Pepe (PEPE)**

**Token Overview:** PEPE is the "emperor" of meme coins, drawing on over a decade of internet culture.

### **8.1 The Soundtrack of the "Deplorables"**

PEPE's musical identity is darker and more aggressive than its peers. It often utilizes "Phonk"—a subgenre of hip-hop characterized by distorted bass, cowbells, and dark, lo-fi samples.

* **Themes:** Dominance, revenge, and "meme magic." The music reflects the "underdog" narrative of the Pepe community—the idea that they are fighting against the "normie" financial system.  
* **Shadilay:** The track "Shadilay" by the Italian band P.E.P.E. (from the 1980s) is a central artifact. The coincidence of the band name and the frog logo on the original record is viewed by the community as prophetic. Remixes of "Shadilay" serve as sacred hymns, reinforcing the "cult" aspect of the token.16

### **8.2 2024 Evolution**

In 2024, as PEPE reached multi-billion dollar market caps, the music evolved to be more triumphant. We see a blend of the aggressive Phonk with celebratory, stadium-sized electronic beats. The "King Prawn" meme 17 also introduced a momentary surrealist musical trend, further proving the community's ability to adapt its audio identity to current events.

## ---

**9\. Deep Dive Case Study: SHIB & DOGE (The Legacy Coins)**

**Token Overview:** DOGE and SHIB are the "Boomer" meme coins. They have matured beyond the chaotic energy of the Solana trenches.

### **9.1 SHIB: The Pivot to Pop**

The snippet referencing a SHIB-associated song "The Only Thing I'm Living For" (Genre: Pop, Year: 2025\) suggests a significant shift.18 SHIB is attempting to position itself as a serious ecosystem with its own blockchain (Shibarium). Consequently, its viral music is moving away from "degen" noise towards polished, mainstream pop. This mirrors the project's corporate aspirations.

### **9.2 DOGE: The Musk Effect**

DOGE's viral audio remains inextricably linked to Elon Musk. Viral tracks often feature auto-tuned clips of Musk speaking, or remixes of his laughter. The "Doge" musical aesthetic is nostalgic—often calling back to the "MLG" (Major League Gaming) era of 2013-2015, featuring air horns and dubstep. This appeals to the "OG" crypto investors who have been around since the beginning.

## ---

**10\. Synthesis: The Musical Theory of the Pump (Addressing Research Questions)**

Based on the exhaustive analysis of the data, we can now definitively answer the core research questions.

### **10.1 Musical Elements (RQ1)**

* **Tempo:** The "Viral Zone" is **140–175 BPM** for hype/pump tracks (Hardstyle/DnB) and **120–128 BPM** for looping/dance tracks (House).  
* **Style:** A convergence of **Phonk** (for aggression), **Hyperpop/Glitch** (for absurdity), and **AI-Pop** (for narrative).  
* **Hooks:** The most successful hooks are **monosyllabic** or **rhythmic** rather than melodic. The "Pop" of Popcat or the "Bonk" sound effect are audio logos that transcend language.

### **10.2 Lyrical Themes (RQ2)**

* **Tribalism:** "Us vs. Them." The lyrics reinforce the boundary between the "community" (who get the joke) and the "normies" (who don't).  
* **Karma and Skill:** Especially in BONK ("Nice Shot"), the theme that trading is a skill and that holders will be rewarded by the universe.  
* **Absurdity:** In WIF and POPCAT, the deliberate lack of meaning is the theme. "It's just a cat" or "It's just a dog" are mantras of nihilistic freedom.

### **10.3 Clip Length and Sharing (RQ3)**

* **The 15-Second Loop:** The most critical format. Optimized for TikTok and Instagram Reels. This is where the "earworm" is established.  
* **The 2-Minute Anthem:** Used for community building on YouTube and Twitter. These are less about viral spread and more about deepening the conviction of existing holders.

### **10.4 Platforms (RQ4)**

* **Telegram:** The engine of **retention**. Drives high-frequency listening during raids.  
* **Twitter:** The engine of **discovery**. Drives the initial viral spark through visual-audio pairing.  
* **TikTok:** The engine of **scale**. Drives mainstream adoption when the audio transcends the crypto context.

### **10.5 Vocals vs. Instrumentals (RQ5)**

* **Vocals:** Essential for **Anthems** (BONK, SHIB) where a narrative or "lore" needs to be conveyed. The lyrics act as the "whitepaper."  
* **Instrumentals:** Preferred for **Background Hype** (PEPE Phonk, WIF Lo-fi). These tracks provide emotional energy without distracting from the visual data (charts/memes).

### **10.6 Anthem vs. Background Music (RQ6)**

* **Anthem:** A track that is *uniquely* identified with the coin (e.g., "Nice Shot"). It embodies the specific values and inside jokes of that community.  
* **Background Music:** Generic, high-energy AI-slop or Phonk that is used interchangeably across different coins to signal "excitement" but carries no specific brand identity.

## ---

**11\. Future Outlook: The Sonic Branding of Finance**

The 2024–2025 research period demonstrates that audio is no longer a secondary consideration in the marketing of digital assets. It is a primary vector of value transmission. As AI tools become more sophisticated, we can expect the line between "meme" and "media franchise" to blur further.

We anticipate the emergence of **"Audio-Reactive Tokenomics,"** where the tempo or intensity of a project's official anthem might change in real-time based on on-chain data (price, volume). Furthermore, as the legal battles over AI music resolve, we may see the licensing of viral meme tracks become a revenue stream for the DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) that govern these coins.

In the attention economy, the ear is the fastest path to the wallet. The meme coins that mastered the art of the viral song in 2024–2025 did not just make noise; they orchestrated a financial revolution to the beat of a distorted drum.
