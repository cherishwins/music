## Documents

### MEME_COIN_RECORD_LABEL.md (THE MASTER PLAN)
**"The Sonic Mint: Architecting a Defensible, Sovereign AI Music Ecosystem"**

The full business plan. This IS what White Tiger should become.

**The Vision:** Input a Contract Address → Get full brand kit in 60 seconds
```
User enters: $WIF contract address
    ↓
System fetches: Ticker, price, market cap, sentiment
    ↓
Generates: Anthem + Video Loop + Album Art + GIFs + Remix Stems
    ↓
Option: "Mint & Launch" → Token on bonding curve
```

**Unit Economics (Self-Hosted):**
| Component | Cost |
|-----------|------|
| Audio (H100) | $0.011 |
| Video (MiniMax) | $0.190 |
| Lyrics (Grok/Llama) | $0.005 |
| Storage | $0.010 |
| **TOTAL COGS** | **$0.216** |

**Revenue:** 0.1 SOL mint fee (~$15) = **98.5% margin**

**Key Integrations:**
- Pump.fun bonding curves (financialization)
- Story Protocol (IP rights)
- Telegram Mini App (viral loops)

### UNCENSORED_PIPELINE.md
**"Decentralized Audio: Architecting an Uncensored AI Music Pipeline"**

The sovereign synthesis manifesto. How to build a censorship-resistant music pipeline.

**The Stack:**
```
[Dolphin LLM] → Lyrics (uncensored)
      ↓
[Edge-TTS] → Guide vocal (robotic)
      ↓
[RVC v2] → Voice conversion (any voice - Trump, Kanye, meme characters)
      ↓
[MusicGen] → Instrumentals (fine-tuned on Phonk/Trap)
      ↓
[Matchering] → Auto-mastering (reference-based loudness matching)
```

**Key Insight:** RVC doesn't understand words - it just converts timbre. If the TTS says a slur, RVC converts it faithfully. ZERO CENSORSHIP.

**Hardware Requirements:**
- RTX 3090/4090 (24GB VRAM) - run all models simultaneously
- OR rent A100 on RunPod (~$1.50/hr for training, $0.30/hr for inference)
