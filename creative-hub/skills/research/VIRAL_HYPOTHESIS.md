## THE HYPOTHESIS

**"Loop-First Lyric Design"** - Generate lyrics optimized for short-form video virality by prioritizing:
1. Instant hook impact (first 8 words)
2. Contiguous repetition (stacked, not spread)
3. Short punchy lines (TikTok clip-able)
4. Energy markers (ad-libs)
5. ONE memorable phrase that loops in your head

## THE EVIDENCE

### Our Data (4,832 Hip Hop Tracks)

| Metric | High Viral (50+) | Low Viral (<20) | Multiplier |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|------------|
| **Repetition Ratio** | 49.5% | 15.9% | **3.1x** |
| **Hook Score** | 8.0 | 0.05 | **150x** |
| **Short Line Ratio** | Higher | Lower | Key factor |
| **First Line Punch** | 1.0 | 0.3 | **3x** |

**Distribution** (4,832 tracks):
```
0-20:    4,132 (85.5%)  <- Most rap is NOT viral
20-40:     328 (6.8%)
40-60:     104 (2.2%)
60-80:      70 (1.4%)
80-100:    198 (4.1%)   <- THESE are the patterns we want
```

### TikTok Virality Research (2024-2025)

- **84%** of Billboard Global 200 songs went viral on TikTok FIRST
- Only **15%** of viral TikTok songs translate to long-term streaming success
- Songs average **15 seconds** of exposure on TikTok
- "Discovery through sound" - users find songs by hearing them in videos

### Phonk Genre Deep Dive (31 BILLION TikTok Views)

Why phonk dominates:
- "Built for looping, built for visual editing, built for short-form content"
- Dark energy + hard bass + drift culture aesthetic
- Aggressive simplicity - one vibe, hammered home
- Fastest-growing Spotify playlist in 2024

### Earworm Psychology Research

- **Contiguous repetition** (immediate phrase repetition) creates strongest earworms
- Brain craves "predictive completion" - loops trigger dopamine
- Simple melodies with ONE memorable hook beat complex arrangements
- "Involuntary Musical Imagery" (INMI) - songs that won't leave your head

## IMPLEMENTATION RULES

### Rule 1: First 8 Words Must SLAP

TikTok scroll = instant hook or death. No setup, no context, just impact.

**Good**:
- "Money talk, I don't need to speak"
- "We the ones that run this city"
- "Pull up, drip too hard to flex"

**Bad**:
- "Let me tell you about the time when..."
- "I've been thinking lately about how..."

### Rule 2: Contiguous Repetition

Repeat key phrase 2-3x IMMEDIATELY. Stack them, don't spread them.

**Good**:
```
We up, we up, we up right now
Can't stop, won't stop, don't stop now
```

**Bad** (spread repetition):
```
We up in the club tonight
Feeling good, feeling right
We up and we here to stay
```

### Rule 3: Short Punchy Lines (≤6 Words)

Target 70%+ short lines. Each line = potential clip moment.

**Good**:
```
Get out my way    (4 words)
I don't play      (3 words)
Every day         (2 words)
We get paid       (3 words)
```

**Bad**:
```
I'm getting out of your way because you're not worth my time anymore  (14 words)
```

### Rule 4: Ad-lib Density (3-5%)

Inject energy markers that signal hype moments for video edits.

**Include**:
- "yeah", "yuh", "aye"
- "sheesh", "let's go", "woo"
- "skrt", "brr", "gang"

### Rule 5: ONE Memorable Hook

Single phrase that loops in your head. Repeat 4+ times in song.

**Examples**:
- "Bad and Boujee" - Migos
- "In Da Club" - 50 Cent
- "Mo Bamba" - Sheck Wes

## PROMPT TEMPLATE

## FUTURE: SONGWRITER SKILL

Idea: Create explicit songwriter skill that channels real human songwriting knowledge:

- **Drake style**: Emotional vulnerability + flex, melodic hooks
- **Travis Scott style**: Atmospheric, ad-lib heavy, vibe-first
- **Future style**: Repetitive hooks, dark energy, slurred delivery
- **Kendrick style**: Dense wordplay, storytelling, conscious themes
- **Megan style**: Confident, punchy, quotable bars

Could structure as:
```
/skills/SONGWRITER_ARSENAL.skill.md
├── Drake Protocol
├── Travis Scott Protocol
├── Future Protocol
├── Phonk/Drift Protocol
└── Regional Variants (ATL, LA, UK Drill)
```

*"Hits are loops. The hook IS the song. Everything else is just waiting for the hook to come back."*
